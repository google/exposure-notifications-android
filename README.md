# Exposure Notifications API: Android Reference Design

This is a reference design for an Android app implementing the
[Exposure Notifications API](https://www.blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/apple-and-google-partner-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/)
provided by Apple and Google.

Only approved government public health authorities can access the APIs
(included in an upcoming build of `Google Play services`) to build an app for
COVID-19 response efforts. As part of our continued efforts to be transparent,
weâ€™re making this code public to help approved government public health
authorities understand how to use the `Exposure Notifications API` to build
their COVID-19 apps.

# Getting Started
